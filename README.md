# Belly Button Biodiversity

Builts an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Created a bubble chart that displays each sample for that individual.
